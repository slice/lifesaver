Lifesaver is an opinionated Discord bot framework built on top of
[discord.py][dpy]. It exports an assortment of utilities and helpers that ease
the burden of maintenance when it comes to everyday botmaking, and it's
especially handy to those who maintain multiple bots at a time.

> **Warning**: Lifesaver's raison d'Ãªtre is code deduplication. It's not
> inherently useful to everyone.
